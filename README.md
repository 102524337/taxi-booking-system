Taxi booking system

- This web application is a simple taxi booking service system. Users can register and login to book a taxi. Admin can view users who booked
taxies within 3 hours from local time. Admin can assign a taxi for each user. 

!Missing: 1)log-out feature was not implemented. 2) A session is unset and destroyed after completing a booking. 
          3) The session is unset when it refreshes the site or redirects to somewhere (this happens when user input validation occurs).
          
#Action for improvement: 1) Implement log-out feature 2) destroy session only when a user logs out 3) apply oop paradigm to increase modularisation.
